### Understanding `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`

The `LOCAL` keyword in the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command specifies that the file being loaded resides on the client machine (where the MySQL client is running) rather than on the server. By default, `LOAD DATA INFILE` expects the file to be located on the server itself.

### Resolving Permission Errors
If you encountered a "Permission denied" error, it likely means the MySQL server does not have the required permissions to access the file. Using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` bypasses this by directing MySQL to retrieve the file from the client machine instead of the server.

### How `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` Works
This command allows you to import files from your local machine into a MySQL database, provided that:
1. The file is accessible on the client machine.
2. The MySQL client has the necessary permissions to read the file.
3. The `local_infile` setting is enabled in MySQL.

Using this method ensures a smooth file import process, even when the MySQL server lacks direct access to the file's location.
